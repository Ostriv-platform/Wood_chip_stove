# Stove on wooden shavings

This prototype is a fairly affordable solution for most private homes. Implementation does not require specific knowledge. The only thing needed for implementation is metal and the ability to use tools for metalworking (cutting and welding).

## Instruction

#### Materials:
Body - sheet metal (used metal that can be found at scrap metal collection points is suitable). It is also possible to make a sheet body from refractory brick or clay)
Replaceable container for shavings - old metal barrels (holes and deformations are allowed)
The thicker the metal for the stove body, the longer the service life and the smaller the structural deformations. For a replaceable container, on the contrary, we recommend using a thinner metal, as this will facilitate the operation process (loading and unloading)
Raw materials: wood shavings (industrial waste), chopped branches from the garden and other small non-liquid wood.
Necessary tools: A tool for cutting metal (a grinder or a manual plasma cutter) and a welding machine.
Working time: One charge burns for 8-12 hours and emits a large amount of heat without constantly throwing up raw materials. On average, the body temperature is 150-400 degrees during the entire period of operation.

#### Benefits:
- One charge is enough for up to 12 hours of work
- Can work on any shredded wood waste
- Simple and inexpensive to manufacture
- The possibility of cooking food

#### Usage:
The first prototype is tested in the corridor of an uninsulated private residential building with an area of more than 200 square meters. Its work is enough to maintain a comfortable temperature in the corridor in common areas and part of residential premises at an external temperature of 0-10 degrees below zero.
This stove is perfect for heating warehouses and industrial premises.

#### Description of the design and principle of operation:
We create homemade fuel briquettes from wood chips by tamping them into a replaceable metal barrel (container).
The basis of the structure is two containers. The outer one can be made of a thick-walled barrel (or sheet metal as shown in the photo and diagrams of the physical prototype) or made of heat-resistant brick. The inner container is made of a smaller barrel. The inner container is removed and filled with shavings after complete cooling. In our case, we made 3 replaceable internal containers for ease of use and to ensure the continuity of the process.

Wood shavings and other chopped wood are rammed into the barrel, and it is also possible to mix in non-toxic combustible garbage. At the bottom of the barrel there is a hole through which air will flow to support the combustion process. when filling the barrel, you need to insert a plastic pipe into the hole in the bottom. And tamp the shavings so that the pipe does not shift. After the barrel is completely filled, the pipe is removed and a hole is formed in the center of the barrel that goes from the bottom to the very top. this will allow the chips to burn more evenly and avoid fading. There is a risk that in the case of weak swarf tamping after removing the tube, the hole may be filled with swarf and combustion processes will not take place, so pay special attention to swarf tamping directly around the pipe.

At the bottom of the structure there is a drawer that performs the function of an air damper (shubert) and the stove is ignited through it.
After igniting the shavings in the drawer of the stove, the fire enters through the hole at the bottom of the barrel and sets fire to the shavings. The stove heats up quite quickly. the oven lid can heat up to 200 degrees in less than a minute. When the flame has ignited inside, we can close the air supply to slow down the burning process. If the air supply is not closed, the temperature of the structure may exceed 600-700 degrees. it is desirable not to allow this. From such heating, the metal begins to deform and burn out, and the shavings in the middle burn out very quickly, and a significant amount of heat goes straight into the chimney and into the street.

### WARNING!!
Do not light the stove if the lid is not closed. this is very dangerous because in this case the chip will ignite in a matter of seconds and you will not be able to close it after that.

### Status
Status as of 12/1/2022 - the first iteration of the prototype has already been tested for several months and is showing good results. The second iteration of the prototype with a heat sink and heat accumulator is in the process of implementation.

### The following iterations of prototypes:

1. It is possible to add a water circuit (as shown in the diagram) and transfer a significant part of the heat to the boiler or heat accumulator and thereby obtain heated water in the taps and support the heating system in the house (if available)
2. If you replace the lid of the structure with a barrel (increase the volume of air inside), it can increase heat transfer into space.
3. If possible, it is better to cover the outer shell with thermal mass (stones, bricks or clay), this will make it possible to increase the time of heat transfer to the space.
4. Loading of the inner barrel can be done through the side door. Such loading will be physically easier and will also provide an opportunity to better remove heat in the upper part of the stove, where it is most concentrated.
